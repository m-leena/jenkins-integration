Production-identical environments for development:
 

While Puppet and Chef primarily benefit operations, developers use open source
 tools like Kubernetes and Docker to provision individual development 
environments. Coding against virtual, disposable replicas of production 
helps you get more work done.

 

When every team member works from 
identically-provisioned environments, “Works on my machine!” stops being
 funny because it’s true (now it’s just funny).
