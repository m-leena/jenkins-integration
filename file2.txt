CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND DELIVERY 


Continuous integration:
 

Continuous integration is the 
practice of checking in code to a shared repository several times a day,
 and testing it each time. That way, you automatically detect problems 
early, fix them when they’re easiest to fix, and roll out new features 
to your users as early as possible.

 

Code review by pull-requests 
requires branching and is all the rage. The DevOps North Star is a 
workflow that results in fewer and faster branches and maintains testing
 rigor without sacrificing development speed.

 

Look for tools that
 automatically apply your tests to development branches, and give you 
the option to push to main when branch builds are successful. Along with
 that, you get continuous feedback through real-time chat alerts from 
your team with a simple integration.
